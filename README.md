# NLP_Project
NLP Project as part of Deep learning module. Task was to get a classifier to predict if a sentence has been translated by a human or a machine.
Although the above pynb only has a simple CNN, an LSTM was also attempted but later discarded due to the computational load. Secondly various methods of tokezniation were used
such as the GloVe embedding. The data has not been shared since prior permission was not asked.
